# flashcards

This is a flashcard app, inspired by Anki and Dr. Andrew Huberman, created using Tkinter. 

Key Features:
 - Random 6 second breaks after a completed card. This boosts memory and learning speed. [Overview](https://www.auxoro.com/blog/learn-skills-faster-andrew-hubereman-neuroscience), [Study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124721005398).
 - Randomly flashes a scary picture. This causes an adrenaline jump which signals the brain to remember the events immediately before the adrenaline jump. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPX8g8ibKFc&t=3422s). 
 
Features:
 - Select a deck of flashcards to use (as a CSV)
 - Set # of cards desired to study
 - Sorts cards by due date, displays front of card, and progress bar representing completed cards, and allows editing the front and back of the current card
 - Once answer is shown, rate the card as easy, medium or hard and the next card is displayed
 - Easy cards are removed from the mini-deck and the progress bar updates
 - Bound keys to buttons for ease of use (ex: spacebar = next)
 - Saves progress upon closing the window by writing the updated flashcard deck to the original CSV file
