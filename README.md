This is a flashcard app, inspired by anki and Dr. Andrew Huberman

GUI:

        click/keystroke -> next card
    Stage 3: edit card - front/back
             delete card

cards:
    front
    back
    spaced repetition marker 
    * would be cool if you could import anki decks

random scary sound + picture
    shown at random after you click "next card"

90-minute timer? display/hide

semi-random 10 second breaks

* Release of adrenaline tells your neurons to remember the events directly
before the release of adrenaline, flashing a scary image + sound may
startle you and release some adrenaline, helping you remember what you
are studying. Maybe later I'll wire this up to a shock collar.
